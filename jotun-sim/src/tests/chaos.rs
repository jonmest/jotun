//! Step 8: adversarial-schedule tests.
//!
//! Safety properties must hold under any schedule the scheduler can
//! produce — including message loss, reorder, partitions, crashes,
//! and partial fsync windows. Liveness holds only under "favorable"
//! schedules (no permanent partition, no message storm); those get
//! their own narrower test.
//!
//! The per-step invariant checks already panic on a safety break;
//! these tests exist to drive the scheduler through enough chaos that
//! at least one crash/partition/drop is picked, then confirm the run
//! completed without panicking.
